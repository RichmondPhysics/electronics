\large{\textbf{Welcome to Electronics!}}
\end{center}

The exercises in this manual are for a course in electronics that emphasizes active learning. 
Sitting passively and listening to lectures is boring, and doesn't help you learn very well either.
Instead, this manual will guide you through a series of exercises designed to help you learn things by yourself as you go along, interrupted by me only occasionally to explain some of the tricky parts.

As you work, think about what you're supposed to be learning with each exercise.  If an exercise shows you a circuit that does X, then you should walk away from the lab knowing exactly how to build a circuit that does X.  Presumably, you'll be asked to do so on an exam soon enough!

Your written work will be done in a separate lab notebook.  For each numbered part, you should document your work with a quick circuit diagram or note about what you did, and include any data you take and any conclusions you draw.  Also, any sentence in this manual that ends with a question mark needs to be answered by you in your notebook.

Electronics is fun!  Don't be afraid to experiment!  The worst that can happen is you light some components on fire.  (No worries---they're not yours!)

Enjoy the ride and be excellent,

---Matt Trawick
